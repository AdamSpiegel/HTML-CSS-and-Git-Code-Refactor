# **HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor README**

## Project Description & Goals
    Our client, Horiseon, tasked us with Refactoring their current web site, in order to make it more user accessible for any particular disability and optimized for search engine results.  Horiseon wishes to increase their traffic flow, and with a more accessible site for their clients, the less likely they will stand any litigation as well.  Our specific completed action items are targeted below:

## Action Items 

    1  Replaced all "divs" with HTML Semantic Elements, to make more useable for all accessible devices.

    2  Verify the coding structure of the HTML Elements followed in a logical pattern.

    3  Confirmed all Image Elements contained "alt" attributes.

    4  Placed all heading attributes in sequential order.

    5  Replaced "website" title with a more concise and descriptive format.

    6  Consolidated several duplicate display properties throughout CSS.  All are marked with comments in CSS.
